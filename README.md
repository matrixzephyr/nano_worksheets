Three Act Structure Worksheet
-----------------------------

This worksheet is to help you plan a story around the three act structure.  Each act is broken up into usually five scenes, and the dramatic tension should trend up to the climax, and then release during the resolving action.  This sheet allows you to provide a breif description of each act and scene, as well as provide a way to track levels of tension and the sources of that tension from scene to scene.  You will also have a space for general notes.  Each act prints on it's own page to allow you to focus on one thing at a time.
